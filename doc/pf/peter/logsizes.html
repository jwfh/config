>The PF user guide contains a detailed description of how to make PF
log to a human readable text format via syslog, and this does sound
rather attractive.  I went through the procedure described there when
I set up my first PF configuration at work, and the experience sums up
rather neatly: Logging is useful, but by all means, be selective.
After a little more than an hour the PF text log file had grown to
more than a gigabyte, on a machine with less than ten gigabytes of
disk space total.</P

>The explanation is simply that even in a rather unexciting Internet
backwater, at the far end of an unexceptional ADSL line there's still
an incredible amount of uncontrolled Windows traffic such as file
sharing and various types of searches trying to get to you.  The
Windows boxes on the inside probably weren't totally quiet either. At
any rate: put some sensible limit on what you log, or make
arrangements for sufficient disk space, somewhere.</P
