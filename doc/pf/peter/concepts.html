>Packet filter? Firewall? </H1
><P
>By now I have already used some terms and concepts before I've
bothered to explain them, and I'll correct that oversight shortly.  PF
is a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>packet filter</I
>, that is, code which
inspects network packets at the protocol and port level, and decides
what to do with them.  In PF's case this code for the most part
operates in kernel space, inside the network code.</P
><P
>PF operates in a world which consists of packets, protocols,
connections and ports.</P
><P
>Based on where a packet is coming from or where it's going, which
protocol, connection or port it is designated for, PF is able to
determine where to lead the packet, or decide if it is to be let
through at all.</P
><P
>It's equally possible to direct network traffic based on packet
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>contents</I
></SPAN
>, usually referred to as application
level filtering, but this is not the kind of thing PF does. We will
come back later to some cases where PF will hand off these kinds of
tasks to other software, but first let us deal with some basics.</P
><P
>We've already mentioned the firewall concept. One important feature of
PF and similar software, perhaps the most important feature, is that it
is able to identify and block traffic which you do not want to let
into your local network or let out to the world outside. At some point
the term '<I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>firewall</I
>' was coined.</P
><P
>While blocking &quot;bad&quot; traffic and denying access can be
quite important, I tend to emphasize the somewhat wider and more
general perspective that the packet filter is a very flexible tool
which is extremely useful when you want to <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>take
control</I
></SPAN
> of what happens in your network.</P
><P
>Taking control means you get to make informed decisions, and that, in
my opinion, is when the fun part of being a network administrator
starts.  And you should be forewarned, staying in control is a
recurring theme in this session.</P
