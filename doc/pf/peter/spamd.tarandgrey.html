>What <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>spamd</SPAN
> does to SMTP connections from
addresses in the blacklist is to present its banner and immediately
switch to a mode where it answers SMTP traffic 1 byte at the time.
This technique, which is intended to waste as much time as possible on
the sending end while costing the receiver pretty much nothing, is
called <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>tarpitting</I
>.  The specific implementation
with 1 byte SMTP replies is often referred to as
<I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>stuttering</I
>.</P
><P
><SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>spamd</SPAN
> also supports
<I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>greylisting</I
>, which works by rejecting messages
from unknown hosts temporarily with 45n codes, letting messages from
hosts which try again within a reasonable time through.  Traffic from
well behaved hosts, that is, senders which are set up to behave within
the limits set up in the relevant RFCs<A

>Greylisting as a technique was presented in a 2003 paper by Evan
Harris<A
NAME="AEN1640"
HREF="#FTN.AEN1640"

>, and a number of implementations followed over
the next few months.  OpenBSD's <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>spamd</SPAN
>
aquired its ability to greylist in version OpenBSD 3.5, which was
released in May 2004.  Starting with OpenBSD 4.1,
<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>spamd</SPAN
> by default runs in greylisting mode.</P
><P
>The most amazing thing about greylisting, apart from its simplicity, is
that it still works.  Spammers and malware writers have been very slow
to adapt. We will see a few examples later.</P
